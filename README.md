# About

This is a course project for CS786A based on the paper [_Properties of Sparse Distributed Representations and their Application to Hierarchical Temporal Memory_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07469). In this project we implement the code for Sparse Distributed Representations as proposed in the paper and demonstrate their properties.
